Welcome to Bamazon, your online headquarters for all things to do with witchcraft and wizardy!
We at Bamazon have taken a leaf from the muggles' book, as the saying goes, and now offer
a wide variety of magic products for sale through this application.

As a customer, running the program will reveal a list of products, along with pricing and stock availability. 
Enter the index of the item you wish to purchase, and then the quantity of that item. 
Upon entering the information, the program will give you a quick summary and ask for order confirmation.
Once you confirm, you're all set! Our secret magic methods will collect your payment method info 
and shipping address. You can expect your order to arrive by owl in 3-5 business days.

As a manager, you have a variety of options available. You view a comprehensive summary of the current inventory, or get a quick snapshot of low inventory items. By "adding to low inventory," you can add stock to any listed inventory item. Or, if you acquire a new item to be sold, select "Add New Product" and proceed to fill out the relevant information concerning the item's name, category, price, and stock. View the current inventory afterwards to confirm the update.

Happy Shopping!
